# Randomizer4Good Stream Overlays

## Use in OBS
* Click the green 'Code < >' button at the top of this page
* Select the 'Download ZIP' option that appears in the dropdown
* Extract the files to a folder that's easy to locate

A snapshot of each overlay format can be found in the Previews folder so that you can 
easily see which would work best for your use.

README > Previews

After you have determined which overlay HTML you want to use, you should add it to OBS as a 
[browser source](https://obsproject.com/kb/browser-source).

Use the 'Local file' toggle option.

Note that all relevant donation trackers are included in this bundle and do not need to be added as 
separate OBS sources. 

## Bot Command
To replace the placeholder in the tracker slideshow for your custom bot command, you must edit the 
text outlined in README > commpand-swap.png file.

The files to edit are:
* tracker-slides > donation-slide-sm.html
* tracker-slides > donation-slide.html

It is usually safest to do this via a find/replace action using a basic text editor. 
DO NOT use dynamic text programs, such as Microsoft Word, to make these changes.

You should not edit any of the surrounding text, elements, or containers around the player 
labels in order to preserve the layout's appearance.

## Player/Streamer Names
Player Names can be swapped for the "Player 1, Player 2" etc text on the individual overlay 
HTML files. An example of this is outlined in README > player-name.png file.

Please do not make any changes to these files, except in the case of changing
